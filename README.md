<h1 align="center">Card Flipping Game</h1>

## Description ðŸ“œ

Given one row of cards, each card is either facing up or facing down. The goal of this game is simple. You need to remove all the cards within 2 rules:

1. You can only remove face up cards.
1. Whenever you remove a card, the neighbor cards (left and right) will flip its face if there is any.

## Example ðŸ¤–

Given cards = `['up', 'down', 'uo', 'down', 'up']`
One of the possible way to solve this is

1. Remove the 1st card -> cards = `['removed', 'up', 'up', 'down', 'up']`
2. Remove the last card -> cards = `['removed', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'removed']`
3. Remove the 2nd card -> cards = `['removed', 'removed', 'down', 'up', 'removed']`
4. Remove the 4th card -> cards = `['removed', 'removed', 'up', 'removed', 'removed']`
5. Remove the 3rd card -> cards = `['removed', 'removed', 'removed', 'removed', 'removed']`

It would be easier to understand if you try it yourself by going to the [demo](https://shalluv.github.io/CardFlippingGame/) site.
